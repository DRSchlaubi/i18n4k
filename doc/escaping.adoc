== Escaping reserved characters


The curly braces characters `{}` and the single quote `'` are reserved characters
and need to be escaped.

Escaping is done by enclosing the characters by single quotes,
e.g. `These are curly braces: '{ }'` results in `These are curly braces: { }`

An exception is the single quote. It is escaped using a double singe quote,
e.g.: `This isn''t a double quote!` result in `This isn't a double quote!`
